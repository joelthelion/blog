# Coders Strike Back
Coders Strike Back is a popular AI programming challenge on [codingame.com](https://www.codingame.com/). Players write an AI that is able to steer a pair of pods through a few waypoints in order to win a race against another player. Here's what it looks like:

The contest is organized using a league scheme: players start at a lower league with simplified rules: only one pod, no collisions, etc. More rules are added as the player progresses through the contest. In order to climb to a harder league, a player has to beat the "boss", a well-calibrated AI that allows gauging players' progress.

Most players manually define a few heuristics that allow their pods to play a decent game: slow down before waypoints, steer towards the next waypoint, etc. The most advanced players tend to use search algorithms such as minimax to optimize their steering.

While this strategy works very well, couldn't we do better and let the computer learn a good strategy all by itself? Such is the goal of [Reinforcement Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning), a branch of machine learning that aims at learning agent behaviors.
